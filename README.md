# Computer-Artifact
This repository contains the computer artifact for my comprehensive exam. 
I have already integrated the datasets within the code of the files
It pretty simple to run the files yourself , but beware that it might take some training time when the model retrains itself. 
I have also included the already trained models which you can load through the code used in the last section of the notebook files. 
The computer artifacts are based on the CNN-RNN and DeepLabV3 models which are used in the paper " Automatic Detection of Congestive Heart Failure Based on a Hybrid Deep Learning Algorithm in the Internet of Medical Things " and " High-Throughput Precision Phenotyping of Left Ventricular Hypertrophy
With Cardiovascular Deep Learning " respectively. These Models were used and modified a bit so that it works with the PneumoniaMNIST and BreastMNIST dataset. DeepLabv3 was adapted for classification tasks, using segmentation features to improve performance. CNN-RNN hybrid model was used in both datasets, despite their lack of temporal data.
